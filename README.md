# Meal-Cocktail-Randomizer
DineDash is an app that allows you to quickly find your new favorite dish and cocktail!

## Usage
DineDash uses [TheMealDB](https://www.themealdb.com/) and [TheCocktailDB](https://www.thecocktaildb.com/)
to get a random item according to your search terms, or completely randomly!
When you find something you like, you can save it to see what you need to make it, and hold onto it while you keep browsing.

## Keep in mind
Because TheMealDB and TheCocktailDB are both crowdsourced, oftentimes the information we get from it isn't formatted correctly,
and sometimes ingredients and/or measurements aren't displayed properly.
There isn't much we can do about this on our end, so we apologise for any inconvienences this may cause.
